## Inspiration

Credits to [this outdated extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discord-token-login/ealjoeebhfijfimofmecjcjcigmadcai) for inspiration and some of the code for the extension

## Install

Will not bother uploading the extension to Chrome Web Store, if someone else wants to do it read ['OTHER'](#other) please.

To install the extension as of right now you will need to enable Developer Mode in [Manage Extensions Tab](chrome://extensions/). After which you can "Load unpacked" the extension by downloaded source code.

## Other

If you want to update the license for your own, or upload it to web store, you can freely do it. The repository is open for everybody. No license, no nothing. It's up to you if you want to leave credits or not. Just do NOT use for malicious purposes!
